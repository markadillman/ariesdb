This is the MongoDB for backing the environment assets of the Aries team Infinite Blank clone. This is meant to be run on a separate server with a subnet facing socket to serve database query responses from the web / multiplayer gaming server. Backup functions and maintenance scripts to be added at a later date as performance and utilization dictate.
